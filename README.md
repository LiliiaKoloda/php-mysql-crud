# PHP-MySQL CRUD with CI/CD and Containerization
This is a simple open-source PHP-MySQL CRUD application that I extended in addition to implementing a complete DevOps setup all as part of my transition into Linux/DevOps roles, as well as in terms of hands-on learning.

## What I Added
1. Dockerfile to containerize the PHP application
2. Docker-compose.yml to orchestrate the PHP and MySQL containers
3. Jenkinsfile to automate the CI/CD pipeline (build, test, deploy)
4. GitHub Actions workflow (main.yml) to practice pipeline integration on GitHub

## Technologies Used
1. PHP
2. MySQL
4. Docker
5. Docker Compose
6. Jenkins
7. GitHub Actions

## Purpose
This project demonstrates my ability to:
1. Work with existing open-source code
2. Containerize and orchestrate a multi-service application
3. Set up CI/CD using Jenkins and GitHub Actions
4. Automate key stages of the development lifecycle

## Notes
This project was created as part of my DevOps learning journey and practical experience building automation workflows for Linux-based systems.
